# HAPIS “Humanitarian Aid Panoramic Interactive system”

## Welcome to HAPIS project

This project was started as Google Summer of Code 2020 project by my mentor Claudia Diosan as “Homeless Aid Panoramic Interactive system” but due to Covid-19 the launch lagged behind. It was decided that it needs refurbishment and the project refurbishment has started as Google Summer Of Code 2023 project.

It is an Android application that aims to connect people all over the world together to allow people who want to donate something to help those who need or seek something. Things donated can fall into many categories such as Food, Clothes, Toys & games, Books & Media, Electronics, Pet food, Baby items, Housing items….etc. Besides, it can be connected with the Liquid Galaxy System to view all global and local statistics for each city as well as show users information for each city, donors and seekers.
