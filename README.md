# HAPIS Refurbishment "Humanitarian Aid Panoramic Interactive System"
 The main idea of HAPIS Refurbishment is to have a simple functional application that is able to connect those who need something with those willing to offer it through an android mobile application where the user can simply fill in a form or view the list of seekers & givers any place in the world. Things offered can fall in any category such as food, clothes, electronics, books...etc. We will use the technology of Liquid Galaxy in order to visualize all Humanitarian actions all around the world by viewing on the LG the number of people currently offering something, or seeking something as well as some statistics such as the number of successful donations that happened either locally or globally. Controlling the LG would be through an android tablet application.
